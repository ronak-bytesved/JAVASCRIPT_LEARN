// there are three variable
// 1. let - It is block scoped, meaning that the variables declared with let are
// available for the entire block of code where they have been declared. If we try to access them

// 2. const - it is also block scoped  but once assigned its value cannot be changed.
// if we try to assign again then it will give an error.

//  3. var - It is function scoped i.e., the variables declared using var are
// available within the whole function regardless of block scope. So, if you declare a variable
// inside a block (if, while etc.), itâ€™s still accessible outside of that block. However,
//  functions declared using var are hoisted and hence become globally accessible even though they were declared inside a
